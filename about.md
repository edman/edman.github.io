<p class="caption">Beach trip, a day before my yearly winter swim</p>

I currently pursue a master's degree in computer science at [Seoul National
University](http://www.useoul.edu) (SNU), where I'm a member of the *Computational Theory and Algorithm
Engineering Lab* under the supervision of professor [S.R.
Satti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFDS3bEAAAAJ&hl=en). My
research focuses on applications and implementation of *succinct data
structures*, such as on the succinct representation of Json documents.

<p class="caption">Probably my favorite place in SK Planet. Late night pool,
anyone?</p>

In early 2015 I was a backend engineering intern at [SK
Planet](https://www.skplanet.com/eng/). I helped develop the then newly
released service [Syrup
Order](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skplanet.mbuzzer)
using `node.js`. The service was quite new back then, so it was an exciting
time to board the team. My role in development mainly revolved around
optimization and improvements in service reliability, although I did contribute
with a small participation client-side by extending support for product
management with `html5`, `css3` and `AngularJS`.

<p class="caption">Last one to leave the parking lot, that's how hard I rolled </p>

Before starting my master's degree I was an undergraduate student at [Federal
University of Sergipe](http://www.ufs.br) (UFS) back in Brazil. My
undergraduate thesis was on the intersection of programming languages and
formal languages, where I implemented the *formaly sound*
[RePeg](https://github.com/edman/repeg) library for regular expression pattern
matching in `Lua`. This library set itself apart by converting regular
expressions to parsing expression grammars, which provides a more concise
formal computational model.

During my undergrad I spent a winter vacation at the [Brazilian Institute for
Space Research](http://www.inpe.br/ingles/). The program included a range of
interdisciplinary courses on space technologies along with a practical project,
on which my team was responsible for designing and implementing the battery
management system of a satellite.

<p class="caption">Just Wolfie chilling by the school fountain, no big deal</p>

In my junior year in undergrad I went to the [State University of New York at
Stony Brook](http://www.stonybrook.edu) (SBU) on an exchange program. During my
time in SBU I was granted the *Outstanding Academic Achievement Award* for
attaining a perfect 4.0 GPA on the spring semester of 2012.

Besides computers I am interested in photography and sports. I ran a
half-marathon on fall 2015 and intend to complete a full marathon in the next
year or so. I am fluent in English, native in Portuguese, and can speak Korean
well enough for casual settings.
