![About me](/assets/about-me.jpg)
<p class="caption">Beach trip, a day before my yearly winter swim</p>

I currently pursue a master's degree in computer science at [Seoul National
University](http://www.useoul.edu) (SNU), where I'm a member of the *Computational Theory and Algorithm
Engineering Lab* under the supervision of professor [S.R.
Satti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFDS3bEAAAAJ&hl=en). My
research focuses on applications and implementation of *succinct data
structures*, such as on the succinct representation of Json documents.

<p class="caption">Probably my favorite place in SK Planet. After work pool,
anyone?</p>

In early 2015 I was a backend engineering intern at [SK
Planet](https://www.skplanet.com/eng/). I helped develop the then newly
released service [Syrup
Order](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skplanet.mbuzzer)
using `node.js`. The service was quite new back then, so it was an exciting
time to board the team. My role in development mainly revolved around
optimization and improvements in service reliability, although I did contribute
with a participation client-side by extending support for product management
with `html5`, `css3` and `AngularJS`.

<p class="caption">Last one out turn off the lights</p>

Before starting my master's degree I was an undergraduate student at [Federal
University of Sergipe](http://www.ufs.br) (UFS) back in Brazil. I wrote my
undergraduate thesis under the supervision of professor [S.Q.
Medeiros](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BIuLyXYAAAAJ) on the
intersection of programming languages and formal languages, where I implemented
the *formaly sound* [RePeg](https://github.com/edman/repeg) library for regular
expression pattern matching in `Lua`. This library sets itself apart by
converting regular expressions to parsing expression grammars, which provide a
more concise formal computational model.

During my undergrad I spent a winter vacation at the [Brazilian Institute for
Space Research](http://www.inpe.br/ingles/). The program included a range of
interdisciplinary courses on space technologies along with a practical project,
on which we designed and implemented the battery management system of a
satellite under the supervision of doctor [W.A.
Santos](https://br.linkedin.com/in/walterabrahao).

<p class="caption">Just Wolfie chilling by the school fountain, no big deal</p>

In my junior year in undergrad I went to the [State University of New York at
Stony Brook](http://www.stonybrook.edu) (SBU) on an exchange program. During my
time in SBU I was granted the *Outstanding Academic Achievement Award* for
attaining a perfect 4.0 GPA on the spring semester of 2012.

<p class="caption">Proud finisher of a half marathon</p>

Besides computers I am interested in photography and sports. I ran a
half-marathon on fall 2015 and intend to complete a full marathon in the next
year or so. I am a fluent English speaker, native in Portuguese, and can speak
Korean well enough for casual settings.
